# Steps

1. Go to https://metamask.io and install the Metamask plugin. Once installed, it will tell you to create and account. Just follow the steps until you have completed. Initially, it will connect you to the Ethereum Main Network and it will show you 0 ETH. That's fine.

2. From the drop down list of networks, click "Kovan Test Network". It will refresh and you will still have 0 ETH.

3. Click the circular image and you will see "Account" listed below. Click on "Import Account"

4. It will ask you to import by private key and you can use the one below ( I use the same so if you chop my money, I will know ) : a295af414a19f10e30a6427b91bb410e6aededbbd19791459691a39a4152d0c1

5. If it import successfully, you will see a new balance of about > 2ETH. 

6. Now, install all dependencies and navigate to client/ folder and run "npm run start". The browser will bring a pop-up asking you to connect, accept. All should be well now.

7. At the bottom you'll find the form for a new article. Try filling the fields then submit. Another pop-up will come, accept. Give it a few seconds then it will refresh by itself. If you scroll to the top, your new article will be the latest.

Have fun.
